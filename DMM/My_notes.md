### Here is only my note
This doc is only for myself so I can share. No important for others to make the walkthrough work.

- Do not add media that already in the media library. Sonarr/Radarr will replace the already existing file.
- Never add media for Kids that already have a Swedish / Nordic TAG
- Add 1080p Remux instead of 2160p if its possible. It will be less buff
- The Max Size is around 30GBish can go up to 50GB but it will be a network killer when its a remux.
- Use this releases if its possible. they always works really good. Use them in the order that they are in the list
      - FraMeSToR
      - FGT
      - SWTYBLZ
      - CYBER
      - Tigole
      - RARBG
      - YTD
