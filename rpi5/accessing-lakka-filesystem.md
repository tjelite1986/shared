Accessing Lakka filesystem
It is necessary to access the  Lakka  filesystem in order to accomplish tasks such as adding ROMs or BIOSes. Access to the  filesystem also makes it possible to content like screenshots or savefiles from  Lakka. There are two overall approaches to gaining access to the Lakka filesystem:

Network access
Attaching the Lakka drive to another system
Lakka can also be configured to use ROMs that are served from a NAS for users who are comfortable working in a Linux shell environment.

Filesystem layout
The editable portions of the Lakka system can be found in the following folders. Note that these the only folders which are made accessible via SAMBA – accessing other areas of the filesystem requires a different approach.

Assets - fonts, icons, background images, themes
Cheats - loadable cheat files
Configfiles - configuration files for RetroArch and other parts of the system
Cores - libretro  emulator cores and info files
Database - files used for content matching during automatic scanning of ROMs
Joypads - joypad autoconfiguration profiles
Logs - log files
Overlays - custom themed overlays
Playlists - custom playlists and playlists created by the scanner
Remappings - custom controller mappings per game / core
Roms - ROMs, films, music, and other content, including downloads subfolder with files downloaded by the Online Updater → Content Downloader
Savefiles - save files created by the games
Savestates - ‘quicksave’ states, as opposed to savefiles
Screenshots - screenshots made during gameplay
Services - configuration files for system services
Shaders - shaders for rendering various visual postprocessing effects
System - to store BIOSes and other files needed by the  emulators
Thumbnails - the place where game thumbnails are stored
Update - copy update files here to update  Lakka
Root  file system of  Lakka is read only, therefore any changes to assets, cores or other files used by RetroArch are made using overlayfs mount points. These mount points are present in the /tmp folder, where folder from root  file system is overlayed with custom content. Changes to these special folders are persistent during reboots.

Mount point	Original content	Overlayed content	Purpose
/tmp/assets	/usr/share/retroarch-assets	/storage/assets	Fonts, icons, background images, themes
/tmp/cheats	/usr/share/libretro-cheats	/storage/cheats	Loadable cheat files
/tmp/cores	/usr/lib/libretro	/storage/cores	Libretro emulator cores and info files
/tmp/database	/usr/share/libretro-database	/storage/database	Databases for content matching
/tmp/joypads	/etc/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig	/storage/joypads	Profiles for automatic configuration of game controllers
/tmp/overlays	/usr/share/retroarch-overlays	/storage/overlays	Themed overlays
/tmp/shaders	/usr/share/common-shaders	/storage/shaders	Shaders for rendering various visual postprocessing effects
/tmp/system	/usr/share/retroarch-system	/storage/system	BIOS files and other files needed by  emulators
Where applicable, SAMBA shows the merged content, e.g. share System shows the content of /tmp/system.

Transferring files via a network connection
 File transfer via Samba
Samba is a service that you can enable in Settings->Services which allows other computers on the local network to  transfer files to  Lakka via the CIFS/SMB protocol. Only the most important folders are accessible via Samba.

Windows, OS X, and most Linux distributions should be able to navigate directly to  Lakka’s Samba share by entering \\lakka\ into their file browser. If you cannot reach the Lakka system by name, it may be possible to reach it by IP. Once you have determined Lakka’s IP, enter that address in the  file browser as with the Lakka name earlier, such as \\FULL.IP.ADDRESS.HERE\.

File transfer via SCP
This method requires that SSH be enabled in Lakka, but it is faster than SAMBA. It will also require that you have and be familiar with operating SCP-enabled  file transfer software or an SSH client capable of managing SCP  file transfers.

You may be able to connect to  Lakka via the name “lakka” in your SCP client. If not, you will need to find the IP of your Lakka box. The credentials for SCP are the same as for SSH: username root and password root.

SCP on Linux and Mac OS X hosts
In a terminal, copy the files over network using the scp command:

scp -r roms/* root@ip-of-your-lakka:/storage/roms/
scp -r bios/* root@ip-of-your-lakka:/tmp/system/
SCP on Windows hosts
Download the free software FileZilla or WinSCP, and connect to  Lakka using the SCP protocol (port 22). They will expose the directories of Lakka, you can  transfer files by dragging and dropping.

Direct drive access
This method consists of mounting the SD card, flash drive, or hard drive where  Lakka is installed on a host workstation running Windows, Linux, or OS X. It is not convenient if you have installed Lakka on a device with internal storage, since you would have to connect the drive to another PC. But it works well for ARM boards, where the storage media is an SD card most of the time.

Direct drive access on a Linux host
If you’re on Linux, you can mount the second partition of your SD card/USB pendrive, and access the files on this partition. This way, you don’t need network connection, and you can access all files on your drive, including RetroArch configuration files located in .config/retroarch/.

Direct drive access on a Windows host
Accessing ext4 partitions from windows is not supported natively but you can install a driver.

Direct drive access on an OS X host
Mac OS X does not allow users to mount ext4 partitions natively. Paragon’s ExtFS driver is paid software. OSXFuse is free software. We have not tested either of these yet.

Using an external USB drive
 Lakka offers the possibility to store your ROMs on an external USB drive.

Your USB drive must be formatted as FAT, NTFS or ext2/3/4. Store some ROMs on it, and plug it in your  Lakka Box. The partition will be mounted automatically in a new folder under /storage/roms/, and your ROMs will appear in the menu. Please note that installing Lakka itself to an external USB hard drive is also an option.


Note: If you are using Lakka for PC in live USB mode, you should be able to access the hard drives of the host computer.
